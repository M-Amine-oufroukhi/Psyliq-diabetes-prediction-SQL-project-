# Diabetes Dataset SQL Queries Repository

This repository contains SQL code, screenshots, and a README file for a dataset related to diabetes. The SQL code includes queries for data manipulation and analysis on the diabetes dataset, aimed at optimizing query performance and improving data integrity.

Dataset Description
The dataset consists of information related to diabetes patients, including:

Patient ID
Gender
Date of Birth (DOB)
Hypertension status
Heart disease status
Smoking history
BMI (Body Mass Index)
HbA1c level
Blood glucose level
Diabetes status
SQL Queries
The SQL queries provided in this repository cover various aspects of data manipulation, analysis, and optimization. Here's a summary of optimization strategies incorporated into the queries:

Indexing: Indexes are created on frequently used columns to improve query performance.

Query Tuning: Queries are optimized by analyzing execution plans and making necessary adjustments.

Normalization and Denormalization: Database schema is normalized for data integrity, and selective denormalization is applied for performance optimization.

Optimized Joins: JOIN operations are optimized by selecting appropriate JOIN types and conditions.

Limiting Results: Result set sizes are limited using the LIMIT clause to improve performance.

Query Caching: Mechanisms for caching query results are implemented to reduce computational overhead.

Parameterized Queries: Parameterized queries are used to prevent SQL injection attacks and improve caching efficiency.

Data Partitioning: Large tables are partitioned based on certain criteria to reduce data scanned during queries.

Hardware Optimization: Server configuration and hardware resources are optimized for improved performance.

Regular Maintenance: Regular database maintenance tasks are performed to optimize query performance and ensure data consistency.
